Hi! I'm Nishant Gadihoke. I’m a user experience engineer based out of Vancouver, Canada. That essentially means that I can design meaningful products and build them using code.

With over 3 years of experience in the field while working with 10+ startups as a consultant, I have an eye for finding elegant ways to solve complex problems. 
Over the years, I have realised that there is no single secret recipe for building great products; it is instead a path of experimentation and leveraging your strengths to create value for people. This personal philosophy is something I like to apply to everything I do.

I’m currently running an award-winning accessibility technology company, [Oswald Labs](https://oswaldlabs.com) as co-founder and CTO. At Oswald Labs, our mission is to build new technologies that help people grow, and do it in a manner promoting accessibility and equality.

Having been brought up all over India, I believe that my exposure to various cultures and interaction with people from all walks of life helps me empathise better with the users I design for.

I enjoy the company of animals and run an NGO called the [Street Animals Welfare Society](https://saws.org.in/) out of New Delhi where we help treat wounded stray animals (there are a lot in India!) and try and give all beings a better standard of living.

Previously, I studied Computer Science and Design at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) where I conducted independent research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I'm building studying Interactive Arts & Technology at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.siat.sfu.ca) in Vancouver. Whenever I commute, I spend my time listening to audiobooks and podcasts. [Click here](/#reading) to find out what I'm currently reading.

I'm extremely honoured to have my work recognised by organisations around the world. Recently, I featured in the [Forbes 30 Under 30 for Asia 2018](https://www.forbes.com/profile/oswald-labs/#5e41e2054374)! You can find a list of selected articles about my work by [clicking on this link](/#press).
