# About the project

I worked with Art4Education during the Fall of 2016 to redesign their website and create a uniform aesthetic across their online presence.

>Art4Education is a student-driven, not for profit initiative to sponsor the education of underprivileged children by using our art and talents to raise and aggregate funds.
