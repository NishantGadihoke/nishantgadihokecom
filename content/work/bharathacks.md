In the summer of 2017, I co-organised [BharatHacks](https://bharathacks.github.io/), a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. As co-organiser, I set up the website and registration apart from managing the entire venue and other logistics.

Here’s an extract from a social media post:

> This June, I’m organizing BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs will come together to build products to make lives better. Organized in collaboration with Facebook Developer Circle Delhi-NCR, BharatHacks will help you take your idea forward, from hacking to raising investment and launching your product in the market.

>BharatHacks is free for both entrepreneurs and hackers, to join hands and work towards a better India. From a pool of over 1,000 applicants, we’ve chosen the top 200 to participate at BharatHacks.

>Participants have an opportunity to pitch their ideas to industry-leading investors and startup mentors, including Anil Chhikara, ex-Principal of Jaarvis Accelerator; Bharat Sethi, Forbes 30 Under 30; Paritosh Sharma, Author; and many more. There are prizes worth thousands of dollars.

>I’ve partnered with some incredible technology companies to make BharatHacks a possibility, including DigitalOcean, which is offering free servers to all participants, the .tech registry that’s providing free domain names to all participants, and IBM’s Global Entrepreneur Program, iSPIRT, the parent organization of IndiaStack (the team behind Aadhaar, UPI, and eKYC APIs). Other partners include Neuron, Digio, HackerEarth, Aadhaar Bridge, .tech, F6S, HackSociety, Melangebox, Bizztor, and more.
