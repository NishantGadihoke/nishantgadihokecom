# About the project

[ShriTeq 2016](https://shriteq.org/) was a travel-themed hackathon where we had to create a digital or physical solution to any existing problem in the same sector.

Being a team of 4 representing our highschool, each of us spent some time thinking up of potential problems which we could solve. After thorough discussion and debate, we decided to battle the problem of lengthy and monotonous travel apps.

The result was Apollo: and end-to-end travel chatbot.

Apollo books flights, hotels, cabs, and meals for you. The best thing about Apollo is that you don't need to install any software. Just open Messenger or Telegram and start talking to Apollo.

Apollo finished first after the hosts and [our team was covered in the Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Young-techies-show-skills-at-this-inventors-nursery/articleshow/54987369.cms?from=mdr).
