# About the project

I co-founded [Oswald Labs](https://oswaldlabs.com) with [Anand Chowdhary](https://anandchowdhary.com) and [Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi](https://www.facebook.com/ermahendrar) in 2016 with the aim of creating technology which was accessible to everyone.
Over the past few years, running this startup has taken up the majority of my time. Being a research-driven company, caring about user experience and building empathy is key to shaping our products. 

While it is not possible to explain the nuances of this mega-project within the scope of this webpage, you can scroll down to read a brief description of each of the products we are currently working on.

Alternatively, you can [click on this link](https://oswaldlabs.com) to visit our website and learn about the technology we are building.
