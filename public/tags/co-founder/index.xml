      <description>About the project I co-founded Oswald Labs with Anand Chowdhary in 2016 with the aim of creating technology which was accessible to everyone. Over the past few years, running this startup has taken up the majority of my time. Being a research-driven company, caring about user experience and building empathy is key to shaping our products.
While it is not possible to explain the nuances of this mega-project within the scope of this webpage, you can scroll down to read a brief description of each of the products we are currently working on.</description>
