      <description>About the project The idea is pretty simple — like in the movie, we need a personal healthcare companion, someone who can help us medically when we need it to, both by providing the right information to us and helping us get in touch with the right medical professionals.
If you’ve stubbed your toe a little, Baymax will tell you how to make the swelling go away and will help you get well by providing a treatment.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2017, I co-organised BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. As co-organiser, I set up the website and registration apart from managing the entire venue and other logistics.
Here’s an extract from a social media post:
 This June, I’m organizing BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs will come together to build products to make lives better. Organized in collaboration with Facebook Developer Circle Delhi-NCR, BharatHacks will help you take your idea forward, from hacking to raising investment and launching your product in the market.</description>

      <description>About the project ShriTeq 2016 was a travel-themed hackathon where we had to create a digital or physical solution to any existing problem in the same sector.
Being a team of 4 representing our highschool, each of us spent some time thinking up of potential problems which we could solve. After thorough discussion and debate, we decided to battle the problem of lengthy and monotonous travel apps.
The result was Apollo: and end-to-end travel chatbot.</description>
