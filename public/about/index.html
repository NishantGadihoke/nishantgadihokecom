		                    <p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Nishant Gadihoke. I’m a user experience engineer based out of New Delhi, India. That essentially means that I can design meaningful products and build them using code.</p>

<p>With over 3 years of experience in the field while working with 10+ startups as a consultant, I have an eye for finding elegant ways to solve complex problems.
Over the years, I have realised that there is no single secret recipe for building great products; it is instead a path of experimentation and leveraging your strengths to create value for people. This personal philosophy is something I like to apply to everything I do.</p>

    <span class="image-caption">I'm not very good with photos</span>
</div>

<p>I’m currently running an award-winning accessibility technology company, <a href="https://oswaldlabs.com">Oswald Labs</a> as co-founder and CTO. At Oswald Labs, our mission is to build new technologies that help people grow, and do it in a manner promoting accessibility and equality.</p>

<p>Having been brought up all over India, I believe that my exposure to various cultures and interaction with people from all walks of life helps me empathise better with the users I design for.</p>

<p>I enjoy the company of animals and run an NGO called the <a href="https://saws.org.in/">Street Animals Welfare Society</a> out of New Delhi where we help treat wounded stray animals (there are a lot in India!) and try and give all beings a better standard of living.</p>

    <span class="image-caption">This little one is called Sonu</span>
</div>

<p>Currently, I study Computer Science and Design at <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT Delhi</a> where I&rsquo;m conducting independent research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. Whenever I commute, I spend my time listening to audiobooks and podcasts. <a href="/#reading">Click here</a> to find out what I&rsquo;m currently reading.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m extremely honoured to have my work recognised by organisations around the world. Recently, I featured in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/oswald-labs/#5e41e2054374">Forbes 30 Under 30 for Asia 2018</a>! You can find a list of selected articles about my work by <a href="/#press">clicking on this link</a>.</p>
