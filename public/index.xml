      <description>About the project I co-founded Oswald Labs with Anand Chowdhary and Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi in 2016 with the aim of creating technology which was accessible to everyone. Over the past few years, running this startup has taken up the majority of my time. Being a research-driven company, caring about user experience and building empathy is key to shaping our products.
While it is not possible to explain the nuances of this mega-project within the scope of this webpage, you can scroll down to read a brief description of each of the products we are currently working on.</description>

      <description>About the project Indikala is Asia&amp;rsquo;s premier online store for Indian handicrafts and home decor.
I led the design team to overhaul the visual identity of the store as it debuted in European and North American markets. The task was to create a unique and memorable visual identity which would resonate with existing customers and would help increase conversion rates for new ones.
The process Before rushing in to create a new brand identity, it was important to examine the previous one and observe where it worked and where it didn’t.</description>

      <description>About the project In the summer of 2015, my highschool’s graduating class took up an initiative with the aim of helping students discover their passions. Working with the best of the class of 2015 in 18 different fields, they conducted a series of workshops that were attended by over 100 students along with interactive online content that benefitted over 3,000.
I was part of the design and development team that was responsible for building a framework for the interactive content for all 18 fields, the event website, and a keynote video that featured the likes of Steve Jobs and Sir Ken Robinson as narrators.</description>

      <guid>https://nishantgadihoke.com/work/searchie/</guid>
      <description>About the project The driving force behind building Searchie was to fix the traditional recruitment process which heavily relied on a fixed group of recruiters who matched candidates according to skills, as opposed to cultural fit in an organisation, early in the recruitment process.
To clarify, recruiters and employers are not always the same.
While recruiters can be an in-house team of people who work for your company and find suitable candidates, they are often freelancers or contractors who work for multiple companies and keep nominating candidates whom they think are suitable for required roles.</description>

      <description>About the project The idea is pretty simple — like in the movie, we need a personal healthcare companion, someone who can help us medically when we need it to, both by providing the right information to us and helping us get in touch with the right medical professionals.
If you’ve stubbed your toe a little, Baymax will tell you how to make the swelling go away and will help you get well by providing a treatment.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2017, I co-organised BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. As co-organiser, I set up the website and registration apart from managing the entire venue and other logistics.
Here’s an extract from a social media post:

Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs will come together to build products to make lives better. Organized in collaboration with Facebook Developer Circle Delhi-NCR, BharatHacks will help you take your idea forward, from hacking to raising investment and launching your product in the market.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Nishant Gadihoke. I’m a user experience engineer based out of New Delhi, India. That essentially means that I can design meaningful products and build them using code.
With over 3 years of experience in the field while working with 10+ startups as a consultant, I have an eye for finding elegant ways to solve complex problems. Over the years, I have realised that there is no single secret recipe for building great products; it is instead a path of experimentation and leveraging your strengths to create value for people.</description>
