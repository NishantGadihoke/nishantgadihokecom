                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Agastya is a solution for web developers to help incorporate accessibility features in their websites. By adding just one line of JavaScript code, you can make your website accessible to a much wider audience. You can customize the widget, view usage anayltics, and more.</p>
                    <p>Agastya is also helpful for people with dyslexia, because it comes built-in with an option that adjusts the color-contrast ratio and typography to best suit the needs of someone with a learning disorder, based on previous research conducted by the W3C and the British Dyslexia Association.</p>

                    <h1 class="pad-top">Sepia Mode</h1>
                    <p>The subtle shift to a sepia theme decreases the stark contrast of bright white light on black text that can strain the eyes, and is recommended for reading for longer durations due to lower screen luminescence.</p>

                    <h1 class="pad-top">Night Mode</h1>
                    <p>White-on-black works best in conditions where there is very little light or no light at all. It doesn&rsquo;t project the bright light to the eyes and the text is easier to read without putting extra effort on eyelids. It also inverts other visual elements.</p>

                    <h1 class="pad-top">Translation Mode</h1>
                    <p>What if your website&rsquo;s content was available in all languages? Agastya comes built-in with Google Translate, so your website&rsquo;s content is accessible to everyone, regardless of the language they can read in.</p>
