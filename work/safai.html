                    <h1>The Task</h1>
                    <p><a href="https://shriteq.org/">ShriTeq 2017</a> was a sustainability-themed hackathon where we had to create a digital or physical solution to any existing problem in the same sector.</p>
                    <p>Being a team of 4, each of us spent some time thinking up of potential problems which we could solve. After thorough discussion and debate, we decided to battle the problem of cleanliness around us.</p>
                    <p>We created Saf.ai &mdash; an app which croudsources reporting &amp; cleaning of locations across the globe using our technology.</p>
                    <p>Saf.ai comes from <i>safai</i>, a Hindi verb meaning &lsquo;to clean&rsquo;, and AI.</p>
                    <p>Saf.ai uses computer vision to detect the type of garbage someone is reporting and post a listing with appropriate requirements. For example if the photo is of a pile of plastic bottles, Saf.ai will tell you the recyclability ratio and will help you contact local organisations which have resources to dispose off such waste.</p>
