                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>In the summer of 2015, my highschool&rsquo;s graduating class took up an initiative with the aim of helping students discover their passions. Working with the best of the class of 2015 in 18 different fields, they conducted a series of workshops that were attended by over 100 students along with interactive online content that benefitted over 3,000.</p>
                    <p>I was part of the design and development team that was reponsible for building a framework for the interactive content for all 18 fields, the event website, and a keynote video that featured the likes of Steve Jobs and Sir Ken Robinson as narrators.</p>

                    <h1 class="pad-top">The Philosophy</h1>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>You are designed for a purpose; something you are uniquely suited to. You show both a natural inclination towards it and a liking for it, and while doing it you maximize your capacity for brilliance. It is this something which is said to be your &lsquo;element&rsquo;.</p>

                    <h1 class="pad-top">The Process</h1>
                    <p>The accent color to the otherwise monochromatic palette was chosen to be a subtle shade of golden. The typefaces were a combination of <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/minion">Adobe Minion Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/styles/">Whitney Sans</a>.</p>
                    <p>The front-end was coded in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. This was the firs time I worked with templating and SCSS.</p>
